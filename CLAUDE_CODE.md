# Guide for Claude Code

This document helps Claude Code agents pick up development of the Alexandria project.

## Project Context

**Alexandria** is a Cloudflare Workers application providing global access to a self-hosted OpenLibrary PostgreSQL database (54M+ books) through a secure Cloudflare Tunnel.

**Current Status**: Phase 3 COMPLETE! ✅ Database migration deployed with enrichment tables. Alexandria is a pure book metadata enrichment hub (NOT user data/social/AI). Ready for bendv3 integration (Path 1).

## Key Information

### Already Working ✅
- Cloudflare Tunnel running on Unraid server (Tower)
- PostgreSQL database fully populated with OpenLibrary data (54.8M editions, 49.3M ISBNs)
- **NEW:** Enrichment tables deployed (enriched_works, enriched_editions, enriched_authors, enrichment_queue, enrichment_log)
- **NEW:** 19 performance indexes created (GIN trigram for fuzzy search, B-tree for FKs)
- **NEW:** Auto-update triggers on enriched tables
- Worker deployed at https://alexandria.ooheynerds.com with Hono framework
- Hyperdrive configured for connection pooling and performance (ID: 00ff424776f4415d95245c3c4c36e854)

## Alexandria Architecture Principles

### ✅ What Alexandria Stores (Book Metadata ONLY)
- Book works, editions, authors
- Cover images, descriptions, ISBNs
- External IDs (Goodreads, Amazon, LibraryThing, Google Books, ISBNdb)
- Multi-provider aggregation metadata
- Quality scores and enrichment tracking

### ❌ What Alexandria Does NOT Store
- User data (reading lists, progress, ratings, collections)
- Social features (friends, recommendations, activity feeds)
- AI/ML computation (recommendation engine, analytics)

**These live in:**
- **bendv3** (Cloudflare Workers): User data (D1/KV), AI/ML (Workers AI), orchestration
- **books-v3** (iOS app): Local user data (SwiftData), UI/UX

## Next Development Steps

### NEW: Enrichment Pipeline (5 Phases)

Detailed implementation plans created November 29, 2025:
- **`docs/ENRICHMENT_PHASES.md`** - High-level phase overview
- **`docs/ENRICHMENT_DETAILED_PLAN.md`** - Full implementation guide with code patterns

### Phase 1: Write Endpoints (2-3 hours) ⏳ NEXT
Build write capability for Alexandria:
- POST /api/enrich/edition
- POST /api/enrich/work
- POST /api/enrich/author
- POST /api/enrich/queue
- GET /api/enrich/status/:id

### Phase 2: bendv3 Cache Simplification (1-2 hours)
Remove redundant KV caching (PostgreSQL IS the cache):
- Simplify alexandria-api.ts
- Add fire-and-forget POST to Alexandria on Google Books fallback

### Phase 3: Enrichment Processor (3-4 hours)
Background enrichment cron:
- Process enrichment_queue every 15 minutes
- ISBNdb client with rate limiting
- Quality scoring algorithm

### Phase 4: Warming Strategy Audit (2 hours)
Remove redundant bendv3 warming:
- Popular book warming → REMOVE (Alexandria has 54M books)
- Analytics warming → REMOVE (redundant)
- Keep user data warming only

### Phase 5: OpenLibrary Update Strategy (4-6 hours)
Keep data fresh:
- Monthly full dump refresh
- Daily incremental via Recent Changes API
- sync_metadata table for tracking

### Legacy: Path 1 Integration
**File:** `PATH_1_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

Original plan to make Alexandria primary provider in bendv3. Superseded by Phase 2 which includes this plus additional simplifications.

See `TODO.md` for detailed roadmap.

## Important Notes

### Credentials Location
- **CRITICAL**: `docs/CREDENTIALS.md` contains all passwords and access info
- This file is in .gitignore - don't commit it!
- Passwords are also documented in this guide for convenience

### Tunnel Configuration
- Tunnel runs as Docker container on Unraid
- Config at: `/root/.cloudflared/config.yml` on Unraid
- Don't modify tunnel config without backing up first

### Database
- Database is MASSIVE (250GB+, 54M records)
- All data already imported - don't re-import!
- Database is optimized for queries - indexes in place

## Testing Checklist

Before deploying changes:

- [ ] Test locally with `wrangler dev`
- [ ] Verify tunnel is running (`./scripts/tunnel-status.sh`)
- [ ] Test database connection
- [ ] Check for errors in logs
- [ ] Test on staging first (if available)
- [ ] Verify SSL/HTTPS works
- [ ] Test error handling

## Troubleshooting

### Worker won't deploy
```bash
npx wrangler whoami  # Check auth
npx wrangler login   # Re-authenticate
```

### Can't connect to database
```bash
# Check tunnel
./scripts/tunnel-status.sh

# Check PostgreSQL
ssh root@Tower.local "docker ps | grep postgres"

# Restart if needed
ssh root@Tower.local "docker restart alexandria-tunnel postgres"
```

### Query too slow
- Check if indexes exist on queried columns
- Consider adding Hyperdrive for caching
- Optimize query (use EXPLAIN ANALYZE)

## Success Criteria

✅ **All Phase 3 objectives met:**
- ✅ https://alexandria.ooheynerds.com loads with interactive dashboard
- ✅ Can search by ISBN, title, and author with accurate results
- ✅ Results come from PostgreSQL via Hyperdrive
- ✅ Response time excellent (66-254ms for health checks, 238ms for searches)
- ✅ API secured with Cloudflare Access (IP-restricted)
- ✅ Worker uses Hono framework for consistency with other repos
- ✅ Connection pooling via Hyperdrive working correctly
- ✅ Enrichment tables deployed with 6 tables, 19 indexes, 3 triggers
- ✅ Database migration tested and verified
- ✅ Architecture clarified (book metadata only, no user data)
- ✅ Complete documentation created (schema, implementation guide, session notes)

⏳ **Phase 4 objectives (NEXT):**
- [ ] Alexandria integrated as primary provider in bendv3
- [ ] 80%+ ISBN lookups served by Alexandria
- [ ] <30ms p95 latency for Alexandria hits
- [ ] Cost savings verified (90%+ reduction)
- [ ] Fallback to Google Books working correctly

## Getting Help

If stuck:
1. Check logs: `npx wrangler tail` (for Worker) or `docker logs alexandria-tunnel` (for tunnel)
2. Review documentation in `docs/` folder
3. Test database directly via SSH
4. Check Cloudflare dashboard for Worker errors

## Architecture Reminders

```
User → Cloudflare Edge → Worker → Tunnel → Unraid → PostgreSQL
```

- Worker runs at edge (globally distributed)
- Tunnel provides secure connection to home network
- PostgreSQL runs in Docker on Unraid server
- Future: Add Hyperdrive between Worker and Tunnel for performance

Good luck with development! 🚀
