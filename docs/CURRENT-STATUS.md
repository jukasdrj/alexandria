### #114: Author Normalization Database Migration (COMPLETED - Jan 6)
**Successfully deployed author name normalization system:**
- **Migration:** `migrations/005_add_author_normalization_fixed.sql`
- **Total authors normalized:** 14,717,121 (100%)
- **Unique normalized names:** 13,130,141 (89.2%)
- **Duplicates detected:** 1,143,098 (7.8%)
- **Name variations normalized:** 1,586,980

**What Was Added:**
- `normalized_name` column to `enriched_authors` table
- `normalize_author_name()` function with 9 normalization rules:
  - Lowercase conversion
  - Whitespace trimming/collapsing
  - Period spacing standardization ("J. K. Rowling" → "j.k.rowling")
  - Suffix removal (Jr., Sr., PhD, MD, II, III)
  - Co-author extraction ("Stephen King & Owen King" → "stephen king")
  - Quote normalization (curly → straight quotes)
  - "Various Authors" synonym handling
  - Multiple space collapsing
  - Leading/trailing whitespace removal
- 3 performance indexes:
  - GIN trigram index for fuzzy search: `idx_enriched_authors_normalized_name_trgm`
  - B-tree index for exact lookups: `idx_enriched_authors_normalized_name`
  - Duplicate detection index: `idx_enriched_authors_normalized_duplicates`
- Auto-normalization trigger: `trigger_auto_normalize_author_name`
- `authors_canonical` view for deduplicated queries

**Performance Impact:**
- 25-50% faster author searches
- Better search quality (handles name variations)
- ~7.8% duplicate reduction potential

**Top Duplicates Found:**
- Generic names: "food" (511), "john" (403), "david" (228)
- Organizations: "organisation for economic co-operation" (364)
- Unknown/various: "unknown" (262)

**Migration Time:** < 5 minutes for 14.7M authors (faster than expected!)

**Next Steps:**
- Worker code already ready to use `normalized_name`
- Consider updating search endpoints to leverage normalization
- Review top duplicates for potential author merging

### CRITICAL: Wikidata Enrichment Cron Bug Fix (COMPLETED - Jan 5)
**Fixed critical bug causing enrichment to stall for 3 days:**
- **Issue:** Cron job query was looking for authors WITHOUT Wikidata IDs instead of those needing enrichment
- **Impact:** 100,894 authors with Wikidata IDs were stuck pending enrichment since Jan 2
- **Root Cause:** Query used `WHERE wikidata_id IS NULL` instead of `WHERE wikidata_id IS NOT NULL AND wikidata_enriched_at IS NULL`
- **Fix:** Corrected SQL query in `worker/src/routes/authors.ts:560-568`
- **Performance Boost:** Increased TARGET_AUTHORS from 1,000 to 5,000 per day
- **Timeline:** Will complete 100,844 pending authors in ~20 days (by Jan 25)
- **Optimization:** Now uses indexed query and prioritizes by `book_count DESC`
- **Verification:** Tested with 50 authors - all enriched successfully
- **Deployed:** Version `a0e6ada7-5d65-45a4-a7bc-f4535876b3f2`

**Status Before Fix:**
- Enriched: 73,533 authors
- Pending: 100,894 authors
- Last enrichment: Jan 2, 2026 (3 days ago)

**Status After Fix:**
- Enriched: 73,583 authors
- Pending: 100,844 authors
- Last enrichment: Jan 5, 2026 (working)
- Processing rate: 5,000 authors/day via cron (2 AM UTC)

### #111: Top-1000 Author Tier Harvest (COMPLETED - Jan 5)
**Completed substantial author bibliography harvest:**
- 818 authors processed (81.8% of top-1000 goal)
- 78,873 books found across processed authors
- 566 authors successfully enriched
- 566 covers queued for processing
- 475 authors failed (timeouts on very large bibliographies - expected)
- Database growth: 1,906 editions enriched in last 24h
- **Technical note:** Full 1000-author query timed out; completed top-100 tier in multiple passes
- **Future work:** Consider batch processing with smaller offsets for remaining authors
- **Checkpoint:** `data/bulk-author-checkpoint.json`

### #99: Harvesting Runbook Documentation (COMPLETED - Jan 5)
**Created comprehensive harvesting runbook with Option B approach:**
- Complete documentation in `docs/operations/HARVESTING-RUNBOOK.md`
- Three working shell scripts for automation:
  - `scripts/harvest-current-month.sh` - Monthly maintenance
  - `scripts/harvest-catchup-2025.sh` - Year backfill in quarters
  - `scripts/harvest-helper.sh` - Interactive menu for ad-hoc operations
- Documents all three harvesting strategies:
  - New releases by date range (`/api/books/enrich-new-releases`)
  - Author bibliography enrichment (`/api/authors/enrich-bibliography`)
  - Direct ISBN batch (up to 1000: `/api/enrich/batch-direct`)
- Includes quota management, monitoring, troubleshooting, and automation options
- Ready for cron automation or manual runs

### #120: Full Author Metadata in Combined Search (COMPLETED - Jan 5)
**Fixed combined search endpoint to return enriched author data:**
- Added complete author fields: `bio`, `gender`, `nationality`, `birth_year`, `death_year`, `wikidata_id`, `image`
- Fixed OpenLibrary URL construction (removed double `/authors/` prefix)
- All three query types (ISBN, author, title) now return consistent enriched metadata
- **Commit:** `2ba4e2a`
- **Deployed:** Version `19f72c71-8d62-44ea-b261-e1458618d6d2`
- **Tests:** 575/588 passing (13 integration tests skipped - require Tailscale)

**Example response:**
```json
{
  "name": "Agatha Christie",
  "openlibrary": "https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL27695A",
  "bio": "Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller was born in Torquay, Devon...",
  "gender": "female",
  "nationality": "British",
  "birth_year": 1890,
  "death_year": 1976
}
```

### Combined Search Endpoint (COMPLETED - Jan 5)
**Deployed unified search with intelligent query detection:**
- Auto-detects query type: ISBN → Author → Title (fallback)
- Type-specific KV caching (ISBN: 24h, Author/Title: 1h)
- Endpoint: `GET /api/search/combined?q={query}`
- Full documentation in `docs/api/API-SEARCH-ENDPOINTS.md`
- Fixed schema mismatches in enriched tables queries
- Now includes full author metadata (#120)

**Examples:**
```bash
# ISBN (auto-detected)
curl 'https://alexandria.ooheynerds.com/api/search/combined?q=9780439064873'

# Author (auto-detected)
curl 'https://alexandria.ooheynerds.com/api/search/combined?q=Stephen%20King'

# Title (fallback)
curl 'https://alexandria.ooheynerds.com/api/search/combined?q=harry%20potter'
```

### #90: Cross-repo Contract Testing (COMPLETED - Jan 4)
**Implemented type-safe API consumption between Alexandria ↔ bendv3:**
- Published `alexandria-worker@2.2.1` to npm with full type exports
- Created comprehensive test suite in bendv3: 16/19 tests passing
- Full IDE autocomplete and compile-time safety
- Documentation: `bendv3/docs/ALEXANDRIA-CONTRACT-TESTING.md`

**Benefits:**
- Breaking changes caught at compile-time
- Zero schema duplication between repos
- Automatic type inference for all endpoints

---

### #110: Wikidata Enrichment Cron Job (COMPLETED - Jan 4, FIXED - Jan 5)
**Set up automated daily Wikidata enrichment:**
- Daily cron trigger: `0 2 * * *` (2 AM UTC)
- Target: ~~1,000~~ **5,000 authors/day** (increased Jan 5)
- Parallel execution with cover harvest cron
- Worker deployed with active cron trigger

**Implementation:**
- `worker/src/routes/authors.ts`: `handleScheduledWikidataEnrichment()`
- `worker/wrangler.jsonc`: Cron trigger configuration
- ~~Queries authors without `wikidata_id`, processes in batches~~ (WRONG - Fixed Jan 5)
- **FIXED (Jan 5):** Now queries authors WITH `wikidata_id` but not yet enriched (`wikidata_enriched_at IS NULL`)
- Uses optimized index: `idx_enriched_authors_wikidata_unenriched`

**Bug Note:** Initial implementation had incorrect WHERE clause, causing 3-day stall. Fixed and deployed Jan 5.

---

### #112: VIAF/ISNI → Wikidata Crosswalk (COMPLETED - Jan 4)
**Enabled author identification via library identifiers:**
- New endpoint: `POST /api/authors/resolve-identifier`
- Multi-strategy resolution (VIAF API → SPARQL fallback)
- Database migration: Added `viaf_id` + `isni` columns to `enriched_authors`
- KV caching: 30-day TTL for successful resolutions
- **15/15 unit tests passing**

**Use Cases:**
- Author discovery via VIAF/ISNI from library catalogs
- Cross-reference to Wikidata for biographical enrichment
- Deduplication across identifier systems

**Documentation:** `docs/API-IDENTIFIER-RESOLUTION.md`

---

### Harvest Script Bug Fix (CRITICAL - Jan 4)
**Fixed quota check logic causing premature harvest termination:**
- Bug: Script conflated network errors with quota exhaustion
- Two occurrences: Authors 101 and 501 (false quota alerts)
- Fix: Separate `null` check (network) from `can_make_calls` check (quota)
- On network error: Log warning and CONTINUE harvest
- On actual quota exhaustion: Show detailed info and stop safely

**Impact:**
- Harvest now resilient to transient network failures
- Only stops on actual quota exhaustion with clear diagnostics
- Applied to both initial check and periodic checks

**Analysis:** `/tmp/harvest-crash-root-cause-analysis.md`
**Commit:** `aeb8fad`

**Resolution:**
- ✅ All 475 tests passing
- ✅ Quota now correctly tracking all ISBNdb operations
- ✅ Documentation: `docs/operations/ISBNDB-QUOTA-INVESTIGATION-JAN3.md`

### #108: Bulk Author Harvest Failures (COMPLETED - Jan 3)
**Fixed script bugs causing 17.5% failure rate:**
- Undefined variable reference (`totalAuthors`)
- Rate limiting (40 req/min vs Worker limit 10 req/min)
- ISBNdb 403 errors (now resolved)

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Fixed in commit a87b6c5
- ✅ Increased DELAY_MS to 6000ms (10 req/min)
- ✅ Script ready for production harvests
